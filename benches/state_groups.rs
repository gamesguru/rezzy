//! Compares HAMT against a model of Synapse's state-group storage: each
//! event's state change is persisted as a small delta row against the
//! *previous* state group (`state_groups_state` + `state_group_edges` in
//! Synapse's schema), not as a snapshot of the whole room state. That's the
//! literal `O(S)` write Synapse advertises — `S` here is the size of one
//! delta, normally 1-2 rows, not the room's full state size `N`.
//!
//! `persistence.rs` already shows HAMT beats a naive "re-serialize
//! everything" baseline by orders of magnitude on writes. Synapse's design
//! also beats that naive baseline on writes — its delta rows are smaller
//! than HAMT's persisted spine nodes, since a HAMT write still has to
//! persist `O(log32 N)` *internal* nodes even though only one leaf changed.
//! So on pure write cost, delta-chain-per-event can look better than HAMT.
//!
//! The cost that doesn't show up in a write-only benchmark: a pure delta
//! chain has to *read* by walking parent edges back to a full snapshot,
//! accumulating rows as it goes, until it finds the key it's looking for
//! (or reaches the snapshot at the bottom). Chain length is unbounded
//! unless something periodically re-snapshots — this is a real, documented
//! Synapse pain point (`state_group_edges` chains growing unbounded in
//! long-lived rooms make `resolve_state_groups_for_events` slow; there's a
//! `state_compressor` background job specifically to shorten chains). HAMT
//! has no equivalent problem: any root, from any point in history, answers
//! a point lookup in `O(log32 N)` regardless of how many mutations came
//! before it, because it's a tree keyed by content, not a linked list keyed
//! by time.
//!
//! This bench models both Synapse variants — an unbounded delta chain, and
//! one with a periodic full-snapshot every `SNAPSHOT_EVERY` hops (Synapse's
//! actual mitigation) — against HAMT, on both axes:
//! - write cost per mutation (bytes + time)
//! - worst-case point-lookup cost for a key set once at genesis and never
//!   touched again, read back after the whole mutation stream has run
//!
//! Run with: `cargo bench --bench state_groups`
