//! Compares HAMT's incremental node-diff persistence against a "legacy"
//! full-rebuild persistence strategy, for the workload state resolution
//! actually needs: applying a stream of individual state-map mutations
//! (member joins, config changes, ...) and, after *each* mutation, writing
//! whatever changed to durable storage.
//!
//! - **legacy**: no notion of a delta. Every mutation re-encodes and
//!   "writes" every entry in the whole state map from scratch — the
//!   `imbl::OrdMap`-shaped world where there's no cheap way to know which
//!   entries are new since the last snapshot.
//! - **hamt incremental**: uses [`rezzy::hamt::delta::diff_node_hashes`]'s
//!   underlying alignment logic to find only the internal nodes the
//!   mutation actually created (the O(log32 N) spine from the touched leaf
//!   up to the root) and persists just those.
//!
//! This is the comparison the HAMT was built to win: `state_backend.rs`
//! already shows HAMT loses raw in-memory fork/diverge throughput to
//! `OrdMap`. What it can't lose on is "how much do I have to write to disk
//! to durably record one mutation" — that's a function of path-copying
//! depth, not of whichever crate is faster at cloning in RAM.
//!
//! Run with: `cargo bench --bench rezzy -- persistence`
