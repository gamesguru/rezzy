//! Incremental, refcount-based garbage collection bookkeeping for
//! content-addressed HAMT storage.
//!
//! This is an experimental alternative to a periodic full-universe
//! reachability sweep (see [`super::audit`]) for integrations that can prove
//! every retired root has exactly one live successor. It is not sound for
//! general branching state-group lifetimes; normal callers should use a
//! reachability sweep or retain nodes until explicit room purge.
//!
//! Under that strict-linear precondition, [`RefcountTable`] is fed directly
//! from the [`NodeHashDelta`](super::delta::NodeHashDelta) each mutation
//! already produces, and does `O(|delta|)` work per state transition rather
//! than `O(|universe|)` per sweep.
//!
//! Prefer [`LinearRootChain`] over raw `RefcountTable` — it enforces the
//! linear-root lifecycle at the API level and catches ordering mistakes
//! (wrong call order, missing decrement, double decrement) at runtime.
//!
//! # Why it can avoid periodic sweeping on a linear history
//!
//! A batch sweep run on a fixed wall-clock cadence while the universe keeps
//! growing accumulates *quadratic* total cost over the system's lifetime:
//! with audits every period `P` and growth rate `r`, the `k`-th audit costs
//! `O(r·k·P)`, and summing that over `m = T/P` audits by elapsed time `T`
//! gives `Θ(n²)` in the eventual size `n = r·T` — not `O(n)` per call as a
//! "cheaper index" framing might suggest. This is true regardless of which
//! structure backs a periodic audit (exact `HashSet`, `RoaringBitmap`, a
//! probabilistic filter); the problem is the fixed-cadence-while-growing
//! architecture, not the index type. A `RefcountTable` sidesteps this
//! entirely by never re-deriving anything: each transition's cost is bounded
//! by the size of *that transition's* delta (typically `O(log32 N)`, the
//! spine [`diff_node_hashes`](super::delta::diff_node_hashes) touches for an
//! adjacent-root diff), independent of how large the universe has grown or
//! how long the system has been running.
//!
//! # Timing contract (matches `diff_node_hashes`'s doc exactly)
//!
//! - [`RefcountTable::apply_new`] for `new_node_hashes` — safe to call
//!   immediately once the new root is persisted.
//! - [`RefcountTable::apply_superseded`] for `superseded_node_hashes` —
//!   call only once the *old* root is actually retired, never in the same
//!   batch as the matching `apply_new` for the same transition. The old
//!   root is typically still a live, independently-referenced root at
//!   persist time (that's the entire reason path copying returns a new root
//!   instead of mutating in place).
//! - [`RefcountTable::bootstrap`] seeds absolute counts from a one-time full
//!   reachability walk (see [`reachable_node_hashes`](super::delta::reachable_node_hashes))
//!   over every currently-live root. Needed once, when a store already has
//!   content before this table starts tracking it — the table only ever
//!   sees *deltas* otherwise, never absolute state.
//!
//! # Branching hazard (matches `diff_node_hashes`'s doc exactly)
//!
//! `apply_superseded` is only safe as the *sole* source of decrements when
//! the delta's `root_b` was `root_a`'s **one and only** live successor. If
//! `root_a` has more than one live descendant at retirement time (a forked
//! resolution branch, an unconverged forward-extremity), decrementing on a
//! single pairwise diff's basis can zero out and delete data a different
//! still-live descendant needs. This module cannot detect that case; it's
//! the caller's responsibility to only retire a root through this path when
//! retirement is a strict linear chain.
//!
//! A full structural fix would add per-root reference tracking to
//! `RefcountTable`. This would require:
//! 1. Adding a `root_reach: HashMap<StructuralHash, Vec<StructuralHash>>` field
//! 2. Modifying `bootstrap`, `apply_new`, and `apply_superseded` to track which
//!    hashes belong to which root
//! 3. In `apply_superseded`, checking that no other live root references a node
//!    before reporting it as zeroed
//!
//! That's a real refcounting redesign, out of scope here. Short of it,
//! [`RefcountTable::debug_assert_zeroed_not_reachable_elsewhere`] gives
//! callers a cheap way to *catch* a violation in tests/debug builds: hand it
//! the hashes [`apply_superseded`](RefcountTable::apply_superseded) just
//! reported as zeroed, plus a reachability set walked from every other
//! currently-live root, and it asserts the two don't intersect. It is
//! `debug_assert!`-gated (a no-op in release builds) because computing that
//! reachability set is an `O(|universe|)` walk — exactly the per-call cost
//! this module exists to avoid paying in production; it's affordable only
//! as a debug/test-time correctness check, not on the hot path.
