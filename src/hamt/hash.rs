//! Structural hashing and state-group identity for HAMT nodes.

use core::hash::Hasher;

/// A 256-bit structural hash for HAMT nodes.
///
/// This is a local storage/cache key used to skip identical subtrees within a
/// caller-selected structural-key namespace; it is not a wire format. The
/// structural key is included in both node identity and routing, so callers
/// using distinct per-room keys intentionally produce disjoint node hashes.
///
/// The structural key separates the caller-selected namespaces and is included
/// in both routing and node identity. Its public nature does not raise the
/// cost of a collision within a namespace, so a full 256-bit digest is retained
/// to provide a 128-bit generic collision-security margin.
///
/// # Threat model
///
/// The `structural_key` is the room's `room_id`: fully public, not a secret,
/// and known in advance to anyone who can address the room. This is safe for
/// HAMT routing because:
///
/// - **BLAKE3 is collision-resistant** at 128-bit security. Grinding
///   a shallow-prefix collision (k levels of 5-bit agreement) costs
///   `2^(5k)` hash evaluations; for k ≤ ~10 this is practical (seconds),
///   but only causes O(depth) slowdown — the tree still terminates.
/// - **Full-depth exhaustion** (52 levels = 2^260 hashes) is
///   computationally infeasible.
/// - `HamtBuildError::HashCollision` at max depth is a safe error return,
///   not a panic or data corruption.
///
/// The threat model assumes:
/// 1. The structural key is per-room (`room_id`), so precomputed collisions
///    for one room cannot be transferred to another.
/// 2. Callers of `build_hamt_with_key_hash` do **not** feed wire-derived
///    path hashes through the custom `key_hash` closure without local
///    re-keying via `key_path_hash(structural_key, key)`.
///
/// Because the key is public and fixed to `room_id`, an attacker can precompute
/// shallow collisions against a known room. That residual cost (seconds of compute
/// for a handful of extra tree levels) is bounded and accepted; defending against
/// deliberate depth spam within a single room is an admission / rate-limiting
/// concern at the homeserver level.

/// `RootHandle` is designed for **JSON persistence only**. Its `[u8; 32]` fields
/// map naturally to JSON number arrays. External JSON adapters should default
/// missing version metadata when reading documents written before those fields
/// were added.
///
/// **Do not use bincode or other positional binary formats** with this struct.
/// The field layout has changed since initial design (`StructuralHash` widened from
/// `[u8; 16]` to `[u8; 32]`, version fields were prepended), and bincode's
/// position-dependent decoding would silently misparse legacy payloads. If binary
/// persistence is needed, use a versioned envelope with an explicit format tag.
