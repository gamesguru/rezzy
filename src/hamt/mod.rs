//! Generic HAMT primitives used by higher-level state handling.
//!
//! Layout:
//! - `hash`: keyed structural hashing for subtree identity
//! - `codec`: dense on-disk encoding for persisted internal nodes
//! - `delta`: subtree differencing for set isolation
//! - `audit`: multi-root reachability audit for storage GC
//! - `gc`: experimental incremental refcount bookkeeping for integrations
//!   with a strictly linear root history (behind `unstable-refcount-gc`)
//! - `tests`: regression coverage for the generic HAMT core
//!
//! # Release notes
//!
//! - **0.6.0**: the HAMT storage-GC reachability-audit API was renamed to
//!   disambiguate it from `resolve::reachability`'s unrelated event-DAG
//!   concept. `ReachabilityAudit` → [`NodeReachabilityAudit`],
//!   `reachability_audit` → [`node_reachability_audit`],
//!   `BitmapReachabilityAudit` → [`BitmapNodeReachabilityAudit`], and
//!   `bitmap_reachability_audit` → [`bitmap_node_reachability_audit`]. The old
//!   names were removed (no aliases remain), so downstream code must use the
//!   new names; at the time of the rename neither had any caller.
