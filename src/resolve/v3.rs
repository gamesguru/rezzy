//! Certified Causal Governance (V3) resolution.
//!
//! V3 deliberately does not reuse the V2 iterative resolver. Its caller must
//! first verify PDU admission and construct branch-auth snapshots. This module
//! consumes those certified facts, selects causally-maximal per-key candidates
//! with a total semantic rank, then runs the MSC00C2 synchronous repair loop.
//! It never treats `LeanEvent::rejected == false` as signature verification.
//!
//! # Formal model
//!
//! For verified events <math><mi>E</mi></math>, write
//! <math><mi>x</mi><mo>≺</mo><mi>y</mi></math> when <math><mi>x</mi></math>
//! is a causal ancestor of <math><mi>y</mi></math>. The candidate writers for
//! a state key <math><mi>k</mi></math> are its causal maxima:
//!
//! <math display="block"><semantics><mrow><mi>Candidate</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>k</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><mo>{</mo><mi>e</mi><mo>∈</mo><msub><mi>A</mi><mrow><mi>G</mi></mrow></msub><mo>∣</mo><mo>¬</mo><mo>∃</mo><mi>f</mi><mo>∈</mo><msub><mi>A</mi><mi>G</mi></msub><mo>:</mo><mi>e</mi><mo>≺</mo><mi>f</mi><mo>}</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\operatorname{Cand}(k) = \{e \in A(G)_k \mid \nexists f \in A(G)_k : e \prec f\}</annotation></semantics></math>
//!
//! Concurrent candidates are ordered lexicographically by their semantic rank
//! and, only as irreducible deterministic residue, by canonical event ID:
//!
//! <math display="block"><semantics><mrow><mi>r</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>e</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><mo>(</mo><msub><mi>authority</mi><mrow><mi>θ</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>e</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow></msub><mo>(</mo><mi>e</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>,</mo><mi>polarity</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>e</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>,</mo><mi>specificity</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>e</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>,</mo><mi>id</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>e</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">r(e) = (\operatorname{authority}_{\theta(e)}(e), \operatorname{polarity}(e), \operatorname{specificity}(e), \operatorname{id}(e))</annotation></semantics></math>
//!
//! A claimed PDU `depth`, a locally computed graph height, and timestamp are
//! deliberately absent. A concurrent attacker can pad a withheld branch to
//! manufacture graph height; neither height nor an event ID proves when the
//! author learned of the competing event. The ID is therefore only an explicit
//! equal-policy residue, never authority or temporal evidence.
//!
//! Dueling-admin containment, compactly:
//!
//! ```text
//! promoter -- grant_admin(B) -- B's independent actions
//!     └── A's withheld kick(B)       (concurrent in the declared DAG)
//!          │
//!          └─ certified creator grant wins B's cross-key conflict;
//!             kick cannot erase B's concurrent actions.
//! ```
//!
//! Each repair round selects one maximum-ranked candidate per key against an
//! immutable <math><msub><mi>σ</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></math>, evaluates all selected events jointly, and removes
//! all failures simultaneously:
//!
//! <math display="block"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>D</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>D</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>∖</mo><msub><mi>F</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>,</mo><mspace width="1em"/><msub><mi>F</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mo>{</mo><mi>e</mi><mo>∈</mo><mi>Sel</mi><mo>(</mo><msub><mi>D</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>)</mo><mo>∣</mo><mo>¬</mo><mi>JointAuth</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>e</mi><mo>,</mo><msub><mi>σ</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>)</mo><mo>}</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">D_{i+1} = D_i \setminus F_i, \qquad F_i = \{e \in \operatorname{Sel}(D_i) \mid \neg\operatorname{JointAuth}(e, \sigma_i)\}</annotation></semantics></math>

//! ## Notation
//!
//! - <math><mi>θ</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>e</mi><mo>)</mo></math>: `e`'s verified, canonical causal-past snapshot.
//! - `authority`: the sender's power level in <math><mi>θ</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>e</mi><mo>)</mo></math>; `polarity`: grant versus restrictive transition; `specificity`: governance, membership, access-policy, or generic-state class.
//! - <math><mi>Sel</mi><mo>(</mo><msub><mi>D</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>)</mo></math>: the causal-maximal, highest-ranked writer selected for each state key.
//! - <math><msub><mi>σ</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></math>: the frozen provisional state made from those selections.
//! - <math><mi>JointAuth</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>e</mi><mo>,</mo><msub><mi>σ</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>)</mo></math>: whether `e` remains authorized against that whole frozen state, including V3 cross-key policy.
//! - <math><msub><mi>F</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></math>: selected events that fail `JointAuth`; all are removed together before the next round.

//! # Normative conflict stances
//!
//! | Situation | `tk.nutra.cdo.12` stance |
//! |---|---|
//! | Kick is causally after B's join or promotion | The kick wins normally. B's earlier valid actions remain valid. |
//! | Certified `grant_admin(B)` concurrent with a lower-authority kick | The compound promotion grant wins B's membership/governance conflict; the kick is rejected for that conflict. Under [`PromotionScope::AnyAuthorizedSender`] any sender whose branch-local power level dominates the new value can issue a certified grant, not only the creator — see the caveat on that variant: a peer at the same tier as the kicker can use this to shield the kick's target. |
//! | Equal admins concurrently kick or ban each other | Neither has strict cross-branch domination. Their unrelated actions survive; the membership slot uses the declared deterministic residue — unless one side is a certified promotion grant (see the row above), which wins outright rather than falling to residue. |
//! | Ban concurrent with join for the same target | Ban wins: a safety restriction outranks permissive admission at equal authority. |
//! | Lockdown concurrent with joins | Lockdown controls future admission but does not itself evict an established member. A concurrent join can fail admission without becoming a retroactive kick. |
//! | Kick or ban versus the target's unrelated concurrent actions | Those actions survive unless the revoker strictly dominates the target in both <math><mi>θ</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>ρ</mi><mo>)</mo></math> and the selected <math><msub><mi>σ</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></math>. |
