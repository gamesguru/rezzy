//! Part-B-style responder attestations over an [`UnsignedRoot`].
//!
//! This is deliberately *not* a production attestation-issuing service: no
//! key rotation, no multi-tenant key management, no revocation. It is the
//! minimal thing that turns an [`UnsignedRoot`] -- a locally-computed value
//! nobody has vouched for -- into a signed claim a third party can actually
//! check, scoped to whichever single key the caller hands in. Per MSC4511C
//! ("Relationship to other proposals"), this is the same trust model as
//! archived Part B: the signer is a *responder*, not a room participant
//! whose signature is folded into event identity. "rezzy signed this," not
//! "the room's DAG committed to this."
//!
//! If rezzy grows into something that issues attestations to other servers
//! as a matter of course (not just a CLI/tooling demo), replace this module
//! rather than build on it -- real key management (rotation, multiple
//! concurrent keys, revocation) is a different, larger piece of work than
//! what's here.
