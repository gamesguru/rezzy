# Design notes

Moved out of the README; see also [architecture.md](architecture.md).

## API

Everything re-exports from the crate root — `use rezzy::*` gets you `LeanEvent`,
`SharedState`, `StateResVersion`, `HashMap`, the works.

- **`resolve_iterative_sort`** — the main entry point. Unconflicted baseline,
  conflicted events, auth context, algorithm version, power-level cache, and
  empty state key → winning `SharedState`.
- **`resolve_lattice_fold`** — parallel alternative (lattice fold instead of
  sequential mainline sort).
- **`resolve_iterative_sort_with_deltas`** — diagnostic variant, also emits
  per-event `ResolutionDelta` traces.
- **`compute_state_at`** / **`compute_state_at_streaming`** — reconstruct
  resolved state at any DAG position. Streaming variant bounds memory to
  frontier width.
- **`auth::check_auth`** / **`auth::check_auth_with_context`** — spec-compliant
  auth engine. Implement `StateProvider` to plug in your own backend.
- Generic **`EventId`** and **`StateKey`** traits — `EventId` accepts `String`,
  `u32`, `u64`, or `ruma::OwnedEventId`; `StateKey` accepts any string-like key
  (`String`, `Arc<str>`, or interned arena keys).
- **`EventContent`** trait — skip JSON parsing in the hot path.
  `serde_json::Value` works via default impl.
- Generic `EventId` support across delta compression (`StateDelta`,
  `CompactedCheckpoint`) and core data structures.
- Explicit API/return variants (`ForwardExtremityResult`,
  `validate_forward_extremity`) for "soft-fail" evaluation and forward extremity
  validation.

## Architecture & Algorithms

Under the hood:

- **MSC4297 / MSC4242 resolution**: Conflicted state subgraph expansion and
  state DAG validation.
- **Power ordering & mainline sort**: Reverse topological power sorting via
  Kahn's algorithm and mainline distance ranking.
- **Resolved-state screening**: Sound post-power ban enforcement
  (`is_sender_banned`) for hardened state resolution.
- **Structural sharing & merge fast-paths**: `Arc`-backed `SharedState` with
  pointer-equality bypass for identical parent states.
- **State DAG traversal**: Iterative, stack-safe ancestor crawling, merge base
  computation, and extremity discovery.
- **Native n-way resolution**: Resolve and merge arbitrary DAG forks in a single
  pass.
- **Streaming & batch state reconstruction**: `compute_state_at_streaming`
  bounds peak memory to the DAG's active frontier width.
- **Compacted state deltas**: Forward delta chains with auto-snapshotting for
  fast checkpoint-based reconstruction.
- **Roaring bitmaps & dense indexing**: SIMD-accelerated set operations for
  reachability, auth differences, and HAMT node audits.
- **Content-addressed state hashing**: Incremental lattice hashing (`LtHash`)
  and Canonical JSON SHA-256 reference hashing.
- **Minisketch set reconciliation**: GF(2^64) PinSketch with SIMD-accelerated
  root finding for federation sync. Budget-hardened strata estimation prevents
  32× CPU amplification across the full decode pass.
- **Generic type decoupling**: Parameterized over `Id: EventId`, `K: StateKey`,
  `C: EventContent`, and `S: BuildHasher`.
- **`no_std` compatible**: Pure `#![no_std]` core with `alloc` support and zero
  system dependencies.

## Synchronous model

Rezzy is **synchronous by design**. It accepts a fully materialized `HashMap`
and returns resolved state without performing any I/O. This is not a limitation,
it's a design choice.

State resolution does **not** operate on the entire room history. It operates on
the **Auth Difference**: `auth(C) - auth(U)` — the auth-chain events reachable
from conflicted events `C` that aren't already in the agreed-upon unconflicted
state `U`.

Determining the auth difference is relatively easy and quick: either compute it
on the fly (recursively in 20-50 database hops), or pre-compute and store in a
"chain closure" index (for near-instant runtime performance).

### The three layers

```text
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Homeserver    (async I/O)                    │
│  Bulk-fetch auth difference in 1-50 queries   │
├───────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Rezzy        (sync: pure-CPU)                │
│  Topological sort + iterative auth in µs-ms   │
├───────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Homeserver   (async I/O)                     │
│  Persist PDUs/resolved state; notify clients  │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Typical working set: **10–50 conflicting events** for a normal fork, fitting
entirely in `L1` cache.

### Transitive closure: auth chain vs. timeline DAG

Both Synapse and Rust servers pre-compute the transitive closure of the **auth
chain**, but they **cannot** realistically do this for the **timeline DAG**
(`prev_events`).

#### Transitive auth chain: `O(1)` size (pre-computed)

Homeservers should pre-compute and store the transitive closure of the auth
chain for every event (as a `RoaringTreemap` of `ShortEventId`s).

The auth chain _should_ only contain state events that authorize other state
events (e.g., `m.room.create`, `m.room.power_levels`, and membership
transitions). Even in a room with 1,000,000 chat messages, the auth chain for a
given event typically contains fewer than **50–100 events**.

Live computing and storing of a 100-integer roaring bitmap `auth_chain` per
event is _extremely_ cheap, and it greatly speeds up real-time federation!

#### How Conduwuit and Synapse bypass need for timeline DAG closure

Because we don't have the timeline DAG's closure, we have two different
techniques at our disposal:

**For state _resolution_:** We only need the **auth difference**
(`auth(C) - auth(U)`). Because we have the pre-computed transitive auth chain
bitmaps for the conflicted tips `C`, we can perform this set difference entirely
in memory on integers and fetch the exact list of missing PDUs in a single batch
database query—no timeline walking required.

**For state _reconstruction_ (`state_at`):** Instead of walking the timeline DAG
backward to build state, we use **compressed state snapshots and delta chains**
(keyed by `shortstatehash`). It fetches a recent state snapshot and applies a
small sequence of forward deltas, bypassing the need for full traversal.

## Completed

### Typed content fields (`EventContent` trait) ✓

The generic `EventContent` trait: homeservers implement `EventContent` on their
own content type to provide pre-extracted fields (`membership`, `join_rule`,
`ban`, `kick` power levels, etc.) without JSON parsing in the hot path.
`serde_json::Value` remains the default via a blanket impl.

### Per-Event State Deltas ✓

`resolve_iterative_sort_with_deltas` emits per-step `ResolutionDelta`s alongside
the final resolved state, capturing `event_id`, acceptance status, replaced
event, and phase (power/non-power) for every conflicted event processed.

### Batch state compute (`compute_state_at_batch`) ✓

Compute state at `N` events in topological order, sharing the ancestor traversal
and topological sort across all targets.

### Streaming state compute ✓

Like `compute_state_at_batch` but yields each resolved state to a callback as
soon as it's ready, bounding peak memory to the streaming of the DAG's live
frontier width.

### `auth_types_for_event` ✓

Pure function that returns the list of `(event_type, state_key)` pairs required
in auth state for a given event type.

### Integer-keyed resolution ✓

`resolve_iterative_sort` is generic over `Id: EventId`, and `EventId` has a
blanket impl for any `T: Clone + Eq + Hash + Ord + Debug + Display`. This means
`u32`, `u64`, and any interned short ID type work out of the box:

```rust
use rezzy::{resolve_iterative_sort, LeanEvent, SharedState, StateResVersion, HashMap};

let unconflicted: SharedState<u64> = SharedState::new();
let events: HashMap<u64, LeanEvent<u64>> = HashMap::new();
let auth_ctx: HashMap<u64, LeanEvent<u64>> = HashMap::new();
let mut pl_cache = HashMap::new();

let resolved: SharedState<u64> = resolve_iterative_sort(
    &unconflicted,
    &events,
    &auth_ctx,
    StateResVersion::V2,
    &mut pl_cache,
    &String::new(),
);
```

### Snapshot/checkpoint (partial-join support) ✓

`resolve_iterative_sort` supports this — pass a trusted state snapshot as
`unconflicted_state`. The conflicted events and auth context only need to cover
the divergent portion of the DAG.

### State delta compression ✓

Full delta chain support with Synapse-like compaction:

- `compute_state_delta` / `apply_state_delta` — single-event delta math
- `compute_compacted_delta_chain_from_resolved` — bulk backfill with
  auto-snapshot every `MAX_DELTA_CHAIN_HOPS` (default: `100`) events
- `reconstruct_state_at` / `reconstruct_state_batch` — reconstruct state from
  stored delta chains
- All checkpoint types derive `Serialize` / `Deserialize` for direct storage in
  RocksDB, bincode, etc.
