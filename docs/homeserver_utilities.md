# Homeserver Utility Roadmap

Pure, synchronous utilities rezzy can expose to simplify
homeserver implementations. All follow rezzy's philosophy:
no I/O, no async, `no_std`-compatible, generic over
`EventId`.

---

## Tier 1 — High Value (hot path simplifiers)

### 1. Auth Chain Difference (public API)

**Status**: ✅ Implemented and public

`compute_auth_chain_diff` exists in `src/state/at.rs`. It computes
`auth(C) \ auth(U)` — the auth-chain events reachable
from conflicted state but not from unconflicted state.

This is THE input to state resolution that every
homeserver must compute. Exposing it as a public API
saves homeservers from reimplementing the bounded
dual-heap traversal.

---

### 2. Auth Chain Difference (roaring bitmap variant)

**Status**: ✅ Implemented

`AuthGraph` in `src/auth/roaring.rs` builds roaring
bitmap auth chains. `AuthGraph::auth_difference` enables O(|bitmap|)
set-difference on pre-computed bitmaps — the fast path
homeservers with pre-computed auth chains need.

---

### 3. Power Level Query API

**Status**: ✅ Already implemented and public

`src/auth/user.rs` already exposes:

- `get_sender_power_level`
- `user_can_invite` / `user_can_ban` / `user_can_kick`
  / `user_can_redact`

These are threshold-only checks. Full auth goes through
`check_auth`.

**Work**: None — already done. Consider adding:

- `user_can_send_event(type, state_key)` — checks
  the `events` map in power levels.
- `user_can_set_state(type)` — checks `state_default`
  or `events` override.

---

### 4. State Diff

**Status**: ✅ Implemented

`src/state/diff.rs` produces a typed diff showing what changed between
two state snapshots. Useful for:

- Client sync (computing incremental state updates)
- Admin tooling ("what changed in this fork?")
- Delta compression validation

---

## Tier 2 — Medium Value (correctness helpers)

### 5. Event Well-Formedness Validation

**Status**: ❌ Not implemented

Structural validation before auth checking:

- Required fields present (type, sender, room_id, etc.)
- `prev_events` non-empty (except `m.room.create`)
- `depth` >= 0 and consistent with parents
- `auth_events` reference correct types
- `state_key` present iff state event
- Event ID format matches room version

```rust
pub enum ValidationError {
    MissingSender,
    MissingRoomId,
    EmptyPrevEvents,
    DepthInconsistency { expected_min: i64, actual: i64 },
    InvalidAuthEvents(String),
    // ...
}

pub fn validate_event_structure<Id>(
    event: &LeanEvent<Id>,
    version: StateResVersion,
) -> Result<(), Vec<ValidationError>>
```

**Work**: New `src/auth/validate.rs`, ~200 lines.

---

### 6. Redaction Engine

**Status**: ❌ Not implemented

Apply redaction rules per room version. Stripping
fields that should not survive redaction.

```rust
pub fn apply_redaction(
    event: &LeanEvent<Id>,
    room_version: StateResVersion,
) -> LeanEvent<Id>
```

Room versions differ in which fields survive:

- V1-V10: original rules
- V11+: updated redaction algorithm

**Work**: New `src/auth/redact.rs`, ~150 lines.
Needs careful spec-reading per room version.

---

### 7. DAG Health Metrics

**Status**: ❌ Not implemented

Diagnostic queries over the event graph:

```rust
pub struct DagHealth {
    pub total_events: usize,
    pub forward_extremities: usize,
    pub backward_extremities: usize,
    pub max_fork_width: usize,
    pub avg_depth: f64,
    pub max_depth: i64,
    pub orphaned_events: usize,
}

pub fn compute_dag_health<Id>(
    events: &HashMap<Id, LeanEvent<Id>>,
) -> DagHealth
```

**Work**: New utility, ~80 lines.

---

## Tier 3 — Niche (lower priority)

### 8. Room Upgrade Validation

Verify that a tombstone → new `m.room.create` chain is
structurally valid. Checks `replacement_room` field,
`predecessor` in new room's create event, and room
version upgrade compatibility.

### 9. Restricted Join Rule Evaluation

Given current state, enumerate which rooms allow
restricted joins, and whether a given user qualifies
via membership in an allowed room.

### 10. Canonical JSON Helpers

Deterministic JSON serialization for event signing
and hashing. May be better in a separate crate
(`serde_canonical_json` already exists).
