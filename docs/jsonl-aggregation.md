# Raw JSONL and aggregates

Keep downloaded or otherwise unmerged event files in `unmerged/`. Treat them as
immutable evidence. `rezzy aggregate` creates a derived, sorted event set in
`merged/` for a room, plus a per-room provenance sidecar. The room slug selects
the raw filename family and the aggregate filename is its identity.

The command discovers `.jsonl` inputs, deduplicates by `event_id`, retains
identical events only once, rejects conflicting payloads, and orders the result
by a causal (Kahn) topological sort: parents always precede children, and
concurrently-ready events are ordered by `origin_server_ts`, `depth`, then
`event_id`. It never modifies `unmerged/`.

The merged output keeps the full Matrix event envelope, including `signatures`
and `unsigned`. Non-envelope top-level fields — Rezzy ingestion markers such as
`__rejected`/`__soft_fail`, stream-order hints such as `__pducount`, and
genuinely unknown keys — are removed from the merged event and preserved in the
sidecar instead. Custom keys inside `content` are application-defined Matrix
content and are left untouched.

For each room, `merged-<room>.jsonl` is accompanied by
`merged-<room>.rezzy-meta.jsonl`. Its first line is a manifest (schema, room id,
room version, input file hashes); each following line is one event keyed by
`event_id` with one observation per source file/line. Observations retain the
source's `signatures`, `unsigned`, stripped top-level metadata, rejection and
soft-fail claims, and any normalized `stream_ordering` (from the
`__stream_ordering`, `__stream_order`, `__pdu_count`, or `__pducount` aliases).
When sources disagree, the record reports
`"metadata_status": "source_disagreement"`; no observation is discarded. Pass
`--no-provenance` to skip the sidecar.

Duplicate detection compares each versioned event's Matrix redacted canonical
form (the reference-hash input), so sources that differ only in `unsigned` or
`signatures` still merge as one event.

Diagnostics are written to stderr: input files with non-envelope metadata
produce `[info]` lines and conflicting payloads produce `[warn]` lines. Use
`--quiet` to suppress them without changing the JSON report.

## Finding missing events

Aggregation does not fetch missing events. To inspect references made by the
aggregate that are not present in it, run:

```sh
rezzy inspect gaps \
  --input merged/merged-room-v12.jsonl \
  --json > gaps.json
```

The JSON report contains:

- `missing_events`: the count of unique missing event IDs across both kinds;
- `prev_events`: the missing IDs needed to complete the timeline DAG;
- `auth_events`: the missing IDs needed to complete event authorization chains;
  and
- `references`: the present event IDs that refer to each missing ID, with `kind`
  set to `prev_events` or `auth_events`.

The flat default output is the deduplicated union of the missing IDs and is
intended for piping into `federation get-remote-dag --from-file -`. Missing
`prev_events` are fetched through DAG backfill; missing `auth_events` require
the event-authentication endpoint. `federation gap-fill` can perform both in
rounds when a valid federation signing key is configured. Fetched files must be
included in a later `aggregate` invocation; the original aggregate is not
mutated.

## Selecting inputs

There are three ways to choose what gets aggregated.

### One room by slug (`--room`)

```sh
cargo run --release -p rezzy-cli --bin rezzy -- aggregate \
  --input-dir unmerged \
  --room c10y-fNiMx5ijtgGFibzPUfNs9hpQvnJYPTV-fD2KPk \
  --output-dir merged
```

This matches every `.jsonl` file in `--input-dir` whose name contains the slug
as a delimiter-bounded substring, and writes:

```text
merged/merged-c10y-fNiMx5ijtgGFibzPUfNs9hpQvnJYPTV-fD2KPk.jsonl
```

The slug must identify one filename family. Matching inputs must either all be
unversioned or all contain the same delimiter-bounded `-v<number>` token. If the
slug mixes versioned and unversioned names, or multiple versions, include the
version in `--room` or use a more specific slug.

This mode returns the bare result object for the single room (see
[Report shape](#report-shape)).

### Explicit files (`-i`)

```sh
cargo run --release -p rezzy-cli --bin rezzy -- aggregate \
  -i unmerged/remote-room-v12.jsonl unmerged/local-room-v12.jsonl \
  --output-dir merged
```

Each file is grouped by the room slug derived from its filename (see
[Room slugs](#room-slugs)) and every group is aggregated independently. Every
explicit filename must yield a slug; an unversioned name aborts the whole run
before anything is processed. `-o` is only allowed when the inputs belong to a
single room.

### Every room in a directory (scan)

```sh
cargo run --release -p rezzy-cli --bin rezzy -- aggregate --input-dir unmerged
```

With neither `--room` nor `-i`, the command scans `--input-dir` and aggregates
each room it finds. Scan mode requires a `-v<number>` token in the filename;
files without one are skipped and listed in the report's `skipped` array (even
under `--quiet`), with a warning also printed to stderr unless `--quiet` is
given. One output file is written per room, named from the derived slug.

## Room slugs

`--room` matches a delimiter-bounded substring and names the output from the
token exactly as given, so it also accepts unversioned files. Scan mode derives
the slug from the filename instead: it drops a leading `local-`/`remote-` and an
optional `dag-`, then truncates the name after the matching `-v<number>` token.
For example, all of these yield the slug `room-v12`:

```text
local-room-v12.jsonl
remote-room-v12.jsonl
remote-dag-room-v12-merged.jsonl
local-dag-room-v12.jsonl
```

Passing a derived slug to `--room` selects the same inputs and writes the same
output name.

## Report shape

`--room` returns the bare single-room result object. `-i` and scan mode always
return a report, even for one room:

```json
{
    "status": "written",
    "failed": 0,
    "skipped": [],
    "rooms": [
        {
            "room": "room-v12",
            "status": "written",
            "output": "merged/merged-room-v12.jsonl",
            "metadata_output": "merged/merged-room-v12.rezzy-meta.jsonl",
            "unique_events": 42,
            "input_files": 2,
            "duplicate_event_copies": 0
        }
    ]
}
```

Per-room `status` is `written` after a successful write, `current` under
`--check`, or `error` with `code` and `error` fields when that room failed.
Unlike `--room`, a failing room does not discard the others: the report still
contains every successful room, `failed` counts the errors, the top-level
`status` becomes `partial`, and the process exits `1`. In `-i` mode `skipped` is
always empty, because unslugged explicit inputs abort instead of being skipped.

The per-room fields differ by status: `current` carries only `unique_events`;
`written` adds `output`, `metadata_output`, `input_files`, and
`duplicate_event_copies`; `error` carries `code` and `error` instead. A caller
scripting against `rooms[]` should branch on `status` rather than assuming a
fixed set of fields.

With `--check` and no failures, the top-level `status` is also `current` rather
than `written`, since nothing was written:

```json
{
    "status": "current",
    "failed": 0,
    "skipped": [],
    "rooms": [{ "status": "current", "unique_events": 42, "room": "room-v12" }]
}
```

## Checking

To check whether the named aggregate is current, regenerate the deterministic
bytes in memory and compare them without writing:

```sh
cargo run --release -p rezzy-cli --bin rezzy -- aggregate \
  --input-dir unmerged \
  --room c10y-fNiMx5ijtgGFibzPUfNs9hpQvnJYPTV-fD2KPk \
  --output-dir merged \
  --check
```

`--check` exits successfully only when the aggregate bytes (and, unless
`--no-provenance` is given, the provenance sidecar bytes) match the current raw
inputs; the top-level and per-room statuses are `current`, never `written`,
because nothing was written. A different raw input set that produces identical
aggregate and sidecar bytes is considered current.

## Output writing

Use `--output` instead of `--output-dir` for an unusual destination. The input
and output directories must be different. This prevents an old aggregate from
being discovered as another matching input after the output name changes.
Explicit `-i` inputs must not be the output itself or a direct child of the
output directory; deeper subdirectories are not scanned, so they cannot be swept
back in.

Output files are written through a temporary file, synced, and atomically
renamed. The parent-directory sync is attempted where supported by the platform
and its failure is ignored because the aggregate is regenerable. Temporary
`.tmp-*` files may remain after a process crash and are safe to remove after
confirming that no aggregation process is running.

The existing multi-`--input` resolution path also rejects conflicting duplicate
event payloads.

## Hash inspection

`rezzy hash lthash` builds the BLAKE3 LtHash accumulator directly and prints
both the collapsed digest and the raw lattice, so the homomorphic properties can
be checked by hand. It reads state entries rather than events, so it composes
with a resolved-state report:

```sh
cargo run --release -p rezzy-cli --bin rezzy -- -f resolve-state \
  --input unmerged/c10y-fNiMx5ijtgGFibzPUfNs9hpQvnJYPTV-fD2KPk.jsonl \
  | cargo run --release -p rezzy-cli --bin rezzy -- hash lthash --input -
```

`--input` accepts a bare array of `{type, state_key, event_id}` entries, a
`{"resolved_state": [...]}` object as printed above, or a nested
`{"m.room.member": {"@alice:example.org": "$event"}}` state map. `--input -`
reads stdin.

Elements can also be supplied ad hoc, which is how the algebra is checked
without a room at all:

```sh
cargo run --release -p rezzy-cli --bin rezzy -- hash lthash \
  --event 'm.room.member,@alice:example.org,$one' \
  --event 'm.room.name,,$two' \
  --output digest
```

Because the accumulator is an addition, the order of the elements does not
matter, and one run containing both elements yields the same lattice as the sum
of two runs containing one each. `--field KEY=VALUE` and `--raw-bytes HEX` add
length-delimited field elements and raw byte elements under the same tag, and
`--batch PATH` reads `type<TAB>state_key<TAB>event_id` rows (`-` reads stdin,
`#` lines are comments).

`--dst` overrides the domain separation tag, which changes every digest; prefix
it with `hex:` or `utf-8:` to be explicit about the encoding. `--lanes` selects
the lattice width from 8, 64, 256, 1024 (the default), or 2048, and a different
width is a different accumulator with an independent digest. `--output` chooses
`digest`, `lattice`, or `both`.

## Timeline ordering from the sidecar

`rezzy -f timeline` uses a causal (Kahn) sort by default: parents always precede
children, and simultaneously-eligible events are ordered by `--tie-break`
(default `origin_server_ts,matrix_depth,event_id`).

```sh
rezzy -i merged-room-v12.jsonl -f timeline \
  --timeline-order causal \
  --tie-break origin_server_ts,matrix_depth,event_id
```

`--timeline-order synapse` instead orders by
`matrix_depth, stream_ordering, event_id`, reading stream order from the
provenance sidecar. It auto-discovers `<input>.rezzy-meta.jsonl`, or accepts an
explicit `--metadata <path>`. The sidecar must match the input's room id/version
and each event's payload hash; events with missing or conflicting stream order
fall back to `matrix_depth, origin_server_ts, event_id` with one summary
warning.

`-f timeline-chronological` remains the stable timestamp-primary human view and
rejects `--timeline-order`, `--tie-break`, and `--metadata`.
